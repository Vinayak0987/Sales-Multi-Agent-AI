Current lead to analyze:
{lead_data}

Based on this individual lead's data, generate an analysis in the following STRICT JSON format:

{{

        {{
            "metric": "Industry Match",
            "value": "High",
            "reasoning": "SaaS companies are a core part of our ICP."

        {{
            "metric": "Website Engagement",
            "value": "Medium",
            "reasoning": "12 visits is above average, but time on site is normal."

        "segment": "Enterprise Tech",
        "strategy": "Value-based approach focusing on scalability",

    }}
}}

YOU MUST:
1. Respond with ONLY a valid JSON object.
2. The root keys must be exactly "quality_indicators" (array) and "recommendation" (object).
3. "quality_indicators" should contain 2-4 key metrics analyzing the lead's demographic and behavioral data.
4. "expected_impact" must be a float between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the likelihood of conversion.

DO NOT:
1. Add any markdown code blocks (e.g., ```json) around the response. Just output raw JSON.
2. Include explanations or text outside the JSON.
3. Ignore the provided lead data. Tailor the reasoning specifically to them.
